## What were the LA Riots?

On April 29th of 1992, what's now known as the LA Riots took place. These riot were extremely devastating, lasting 6 days and resulting in 63 deaths and around 2,400 injuries. Tensions were building for months before the the riots, but the shoe finally dropped when the officers that beat Rodney King were acquitted. The riots began with heavy looting and the beating of random people in the street. The LAPD was altogether unprepared for the extent of the protests, and only ended up responding hours after the chaos erupted. Even when the LAPD sent officers to the scene of most of the violence (71st and Normandie), the were woefully unprepared, and after making some arrests, they retreated due to a lack of equipment and manpower. In addition to the beating and looting, there were also many fires set, rioters shot at firefighters when the attempted to put out the fires. To attempt to control the riots, Mayor Bradley instituted a dust-to-dawn curfew and barricaded some of richer neighborhoods that were in close proximity to Korean and low-income areas, as well as declaring LA to be in a state of emergency. Much of the riots was televised, including arson, looting, beatings, and shootouts. 

>"*It was containment, the police cut off traffic out of Koreatown, while we were trapped on the other side without help. Those roads are a gateway to a richer neighborhood. It can’t be denied.”*  — Andy Yoo, an Korean teenager who had to protect his family businesses during the riots.[^1]

The destruction disproportionately effected Korean businesses and people, this was because of the anger and distrust between Korean-Americans, and African-Americans. The two communities had been at odds for years leading up the the riots, with one of the inciting incidents being the brutal murder of LaTasha Harlins on March 16th, 1991, a 15 year old that was shot in the head by a Korean store owner while trying to buy some orange juice, because Soon Ha Du, the store owner, thought that she was stealing. To make things worse; after Du was convicted of murder, his sentence was significantly lessened by the judge to just community service, a $500 fine, and 5 years of probation. There was much resentment between the communities, so when the rule of law broke down, fighting begun. Due to absence of law enforcement in Koreatown, guerrilla groups were formed, many of the members having served in the Korean military. Gunfights in Koreatown were broadcast worldwide from new crews both on the ground and in helicopters.

> *"I want to make it clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed."*  — David Joo, owner of a Korean gun shop that was looted. [^2]

Part of the difficulty in securing the city came from the overwhelming number of protesters and the weapons they had. Many gun stores were raided, with thousands of firearms making their way into the hands of the protesters. Another challenge was the lack of police action, many officers didn't have the training or balls to actually help victims, and would stand by and do nothing as beatings and arson were happening in front of them, they also left shootings for fear of being fired upon. This resulted in even more community distrust in the police and more rage. Instead of attempting to arrest or deter violent protesters the police formed perimeters around city and government buildings. These were rather ineffective as the protesters broke through the lines surrounding civic center, attacking guards and setting fire to anything flammable. On day two the FAA and Lost Angeles airport worked together to re-route all air traffic around the hot-spots in the city including; Hollywood, Compton, Long Beach, and Koreatown. The California highway patrol was airlifted in on the second day along with 2,000 national guard soldiers. On the third day most of the extreme violence was contained. Nevertheless President George Bush sent in an additional 10,000 national guard troops along with 2,000 infantry, and 1,000 tactical officers. 7,000 more troops were sent the next day as there was still much chaos that the LAPD couldn't handle alone.

> *"The murder and destruction in the streets of Los Angeles last night and today must be stopped. Lootings, beatings, and random violence against innocent victims must be condemned. Society cannot tolerate this kind of behavior."*  — George Bush, remarks on civil disturbances in LA. [^3]

## Why did they happen?

The catalyst for the LA riots was the brutal beating of Rodney King and the subsequent acquittal of the police responsible. This isn't to say the that police relations up to this point were smooth and reasonable. Mr. King's beating just happened to be the straw that broke the camel's back per-se. There was an abundance of police with deep internalized prejudice, and just as many cops willing to turn a blind eye what their collogues did. Many innocent people were beat and murdered by the cops. 
Mr. King was driving west on I-210 when a highway patrol officer attempted to pull him over. Mr. King was drunk at the time and knew that if he was pulled over he'd be in violation of parole, so he decided to run from the cops. The cops followed him through the city at around 115 mph, eventually coming to a stop at the Hansen Dam rec center. Once the other passengers in his car were arrested, the police went to take Rodney King into custody. 5 officers surrounded his car, and as soon as he stepped out he was tasered and hit with a nightstick dozens of times. Once he was tackled onto the ground, he was kicked and trampled on, finally, satisfied with the beating they'd given, the police hogtied Mr. King. It's important to note that the officers made no attempt to restrain him until he lay still, Sergeant Koon the commanding officer, said on record that Mr. King was on PCP at the time, a drug test came back negative. The entire arrest was recorded by a bystander, although not all of the footage was released to the public.
Four of the police involved were charged with assault and excess use of force. After 7 days in court, the charges were dropped for all but one of the officers, who was still charged with excess use of force, though a punishment was never decided. Many believe that the courts processes were flawed and that this prevented the Jury from making an just and fair decision. According to reports, the verdict was based on the first 13 seconds of video, which was never released to the press. The video was also replayed in slow motion so many times that the jury became desensitized. The announcement of the trial result was delayed by two hours to give police and press time to prepare for what was expected to be moderate backlash, they had no idea the pandora's box they were about to open. Some suspected there may be some resentment, but no one in a position of power took it very seriously. As a precaution the police chief opened the LAPD emergency response center, but it wasn't staffed until much later. Around 65% of LAPD officers weren't even in the city as they were doing a training, and those that were left work at their usual 3pm.

## How was the Chicano Movement involved?

 Mexican-Americans have faced many of the same struggles as the people of color, you can see the similarities between the Zoot suit riots of the 40s and the LA riots, both were fighting against mistreatment and discrimination from the people in power. That being said, I don't feel that the riots were exclusively about how the police treated Rodney King, the riots were a manifestation of the anger that had build up over years at the blatant disregard for humanity and unwillingness to take any sort of responsibility. It was a race thing, but it wasn't just that, people were sick of being trampled simply because people in power could. Racism in the system was a problem but it also helped us the see that cops could do whatever they wanted with little to no regard for the repercussions.
The Chicano movement parallels the Black Power Movement very closely, both are simply fighting for the right to exist and be respected. So when someone gets hurt or killed without reason everyone should stand up and fight, and that's exactly what happened in Los Angles in 1992. The people looting and breaking weren't just the those that were being targeted at the very moment, everyone who wasn't represented by the rich, white, patriarchal system had a chance to make their thoughts heard. A lot of those voices came from the Hispanic community. For a brief moment, many of the people oppressed by the system stood together, a phenomena all too rare with the artificial divide that's kept in place prevent the people from realizing change. The moment extended a little beyond the riots though, many of the gangs large in LA temporarily set aside their differences for a while to fight for something better. Sadly, in-fighting snuck it's way back and found the cracks, fracturing people and losing the moment of unity.

## What's the modern impact?

The way the city of Los Angels handled the riots made it obvious the there were systematic issue at play. To begin with, the riots should have never needed to happen, if the police actually served and protected in an unbiased way, and followed their guidelines,  Rodney King would have been arrested in a peaceful manor. Secondly, the courts didn't give him a fair trial, and I believe this is because they saw a black drunk black man being arrested and assumed that he was in the wrong (which he was to some extent, he was violating his parole, drink and driving, and speeding), but because of his skin tone they assumed that he was resisting arrest and fighting the officers. The third failure was the city's response once the riots broke out. Instead of attempting to resolve things in the moment by containing the violence and deescalating the situation, they stood by while people killed each other, only bothering to step in once things were far outside their control. Even when the police did respond, they didn't attempt to actually stop people, they protected the city, but not the people in it. I think this speaks to a problem with the police themselves. 

> *"Yeah, it's madness, but it's also understandable. And if the social conditions don't change, it will happen again and again and not just in L.A."* — Michael Ming, 23-year-old college student. [^4]

As for the physically tangible impact, the estimate for damages is around $1 Billion USD, and 730 Koreans were treated for ptsd. As a response to their overwhelming losses, many activist organizations appeared in Koreatown to help rebuild and to advocate for rights. After the riots were contained there was much public pressure for a retrial of the officers that beat Mr. King, the cops were charged with civil rights violations and two were found guilty. All four officers were either fired or quit the department, as did the head of police. In preparation for the retrial ruling, all police and some national guard and marines were on active duty. Rodney King also sued the city for damages and won $3.8 Million USD. 
The LA Riots changed the way police work both in LA and around the world, and marked a huge push towards the militarization of police in most cities. In addition to changing the equipment the police use, the la riots also allowed for police policies to change in significant ways, some changes are seen as positive, and others people disagree with. The good is mostly what would now be called DEI, these changes included a big push to hire more police of color, and to expand outreach into more communities, along with stricter guidelines and punishments for discrimination. The changes I see as negative are increasing the size and authority of police departments and allowing them more control and more involvement in places people don't feel need police. Additionally, these changes to law enforcement paved the way for the Patriot Act, which permits an unparalleled level of surveillance on American people by federal departments such as the FBI and homeland security who often work with local law enforcement.
Ultimately, I personally think, and I believe many others do as well, that police were designed for a society that no longer exists, and if it does it shouldn't.  I wasn't alive for the LA riots, but I was for George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, and I've read about Rodney King, and Watts before him. We seem to be repeating the same history over and over. There's a massive protest about how the police abuse people of color, we push for change, we're promised that everything is good now, for real this time, then a little while later something else happens. I fear that under trump, we'll lose the little bit of progress that so many people gave their lives for. 

> *"I don't condone what's happening, but how else are you going to get the idea across that we're tired of this abuse?" he said. "They haven't listened to us in courts or the ballot. But this time it's not just blacks who are upset. I think everybody is upset with injustice, with the lawlessness of the law."* — Al Myles [^4]

The past is devastating, the future is terrifying.
